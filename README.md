# Tic-Tac-Toe game creation in C programming language

## Description:

This project was created as part of the J+D Python Programming course and aimed to provide an opportunity to apply all the knowledge acquired in the C programming language. This was the final project for one of the course modules.
This was one of the greatest challenges for beginner programmers like me, to try several C language concepts to work together to create a dynamic result.


## How to play?


"Tic-tac-toe consists of filling a grid with one of two combinations (X or O) in three empty spaces, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
The first player to complete the combination 'XXX' or 'OOO' is the winner.
By default, player X always starts the game.
At the end, you will have the option to replay the game and can also see the number of games won by each player."
